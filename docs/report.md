# Ore Processing: General report

This week's work introduced:

* how binary representations influence assembly-level instructions
* use of the xPSR register to determine how instructions "branch" and when to implement program logic

Respond to the following prompts about the programs illustrating these concepts.

## `math_test` required you to evalute numbers for their bit and byte size. Speculate: why do you think these quantites matter?

`TODO`

## `processor` and the `polarity_checker` use two different number sizes. Name and describe each.

`TODO`

`TODO`

## Discuss branching instructions and how they work (be sure to include discussion of the `xPSR` register).

`TODO`

## `polarity_checker` likely required many more branches than you originally planned. Why are so many branches necessary for the program logic?

`TODO`

## `polarity_checker` also used a new instruction -- `LDRSB`. What is this instruction, and what does it do? Why is that significant?
